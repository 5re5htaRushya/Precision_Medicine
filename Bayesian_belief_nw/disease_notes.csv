","Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications.","To heal RO, potent acid suppression for 2 to 8 weeks is needed, and in fact, healing rates improve as acid suppression increases."
Chronic cholestasis,"Cholestasis often does not respond to medical therapy of any sort. Some reports indicate success in children with chronic cholestatic diseases with the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (20-30 mg/kg/d), which acts to increase bile formation and antagonizes the effect of hydrophobic bile acids on biological membranes.",Perform a physical exam. Order blood tests to check how well your liver is working and measure the level of bile salts in your blood.,"If the cause of cholestasis is a blockage from gallstones, those can be surgically removed, and relatively quick and full recovery can be expected. If the cause is damage to the liver from chronic alcohol use, the result may be liver cirrhosis, which may be too severe to expect any type of quick recovery."

An ulcer can temporarily heal without antibiotics. But it is common for an ulcer to recur or for another ulcer to form nearby, if the bacteria are not killed."
AIDS,"HIV medicine is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).
There is no effective cure for HIV. But with proper medical care, you can control HIV.
Most people can get the virus under control within six months.
Taking HIV medicine does not prevent transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases.","Blood tests are the most common way to diagnose the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

People exposed to the virus should get tested immediately.",Most people can get the virus under control within six months.
Diabetes ,"Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others) is generally the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works primarily by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving your body's sensitivity to insulin so that your body uses insulin more effectively.","Your doctor will have you take one or more of the following blood tests to confirm the diagnosis:

Type 2 diabetes is an ongoing disease."
Gastroenteritis,"In some cases, adults can take over-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) to treat diarrhea caused by viral gastroenteritis.

Rajasirobhushanam : Can be used in partial paralysis, facial paralysis, tongue paralysis, brain paralysis etc.","For internal body parts where paralysis is more difficult to identify, your doctor may use X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, or other imaging studies. ","By the end of your first three months, you will have made most of the recovery that you can expect to make. Again, this is a significant divergence from SCI rehabilitation, where complete recovery can take a year or longer.

Without proper treatment, malaria episodes (fever, chills, sweating) can return periodically over a period of years. After repeated exposure, patients will become partially immune and develop milder disease."
Chicken pox,antiviral medication such acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex) to help minimize the symptoms of chickenpox in adults. It is most effective if it is started within the first 24 hours after the onset of the rash.,Usually self-diagnosable,Some people may have only a few spots whereas others will have hundreds.

In most cases of hepatitis A, the liver heals within six months with no lasting damage.","Screening for hepatitis A involves a blood test that detects antibodies produced by a person's immune system to fight the virus. A positive test result means the person is currently infected, had been infected, or has been vaccinated against infection and is immune to infection.","You may be sick for a few weeks, but it may take up to 6 months to fully recover."
Hepatitis B,"Several antiviral medications — including entecavir (Baraclude), tenofovir (Viread), lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera) and telbivudine (Tyzeka) — can help fight the virus and slow its ability to damage your liver.",The “Hepatitis B Panel” of Blood Tests,Acute hepatitis B infection lasts less than six months. 
Hepatitis C,Hepatitis C is treated using direct acting antiviral (DAA) tablets. DAA tablets are the safest and most effective medicines for treating hepatitis C. They're highly effective at clearing the infection in more than 90% of people. The tablets are taken for 8 to 12 weeks.,"A blood test, called an HCV antibody test, is used to find out if someone has ever been infected with the hepatitis C virus. The HCV antibody test, sometimes called the anti-HCV test, looks for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus in blood.","DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis."
Hepatitis D,"Doctors called hepatologists specialize even further and treat only liver disease. There's no cure yet for HDV. Until doctors come up with better options, the drug prescribed most often is pegylated interferon alfa (peg-IFNa).","To make an accurate diagnosis, your doctor will perform a blood test that can detect anti-hepatitis D antibodies in your blood. If antibodies are found, it means you've been exposed to the virus. Your doctor will also give you a liver function test if they suspect you have liver damage.","It may go away on its own. If the infection lasts for six months or longer, the condition is known as chronic hepatitis D. The long-term version of the infection develops gradually over time. The virus might be present in the body for several months before symptoms occur."
Hepatitis E,Ribavirin. Ribavirin may improve liver enzymes and functions in severe acute hepatitis E. Ribavirin monotherapy for at least 3 months seems to be the first treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis E who are not able to clear the hepatitis E virus (HEV) after immunosuppression is reduced.,Anti-HEV IgM is the serologic marker of choice for diagnosis of acute HEV infection. Positive predictive value of a given diagnostic laboratory test is dependent on the prevalence rate of the disease for which the test is being used.,Most people who have hepatitis E will go on to recover completely within four weeks to six months from the start of their symptoms.

Tuberculosis,isoniazid (INH) rifampin (RIF) ethambutol (EMB),IGRAs are blood tests that measure a person's immune response to the bacteria that cause TB. The immune system produces some special molecules called cytokines. These TB tests work by detecting a cytokine called the interferon gamma cytokine.,TB bacteria die very slowly.

A rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors, polyps, an enlarged prostate, or abscesses."," Small hemorrhoids may clear up without any treatment within a few days. Large, external hemorrhoids may take longer to heal and can cause significant pain and discomfort. If hemorrhoids have not resolved within a few days, it is best to see a doctor for treatment."
Heart attack,"Anticoagulant, Antianginal, Narcotic, Beta blocker, Statin and ACE inhibitor","An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important test in suspected heart attacks.

If the result shows low blood sugar (under 70 mg/dL), treat accordingly.","It will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes."

It can take two to three months or longer to see clearing."
Urinary tract infection,Antibiotics and Penicillin,Usually self-diagnosable," Bladder infection symptoms most often go away within 24 to 48 hours after treatment begins. If you have a kidney infection, it may take 1 week or longer for symptoms to go away."
